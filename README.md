# Cloudstack UI
Cloudstack UI is a project which purpose is to develop easy to use, light and end user friendly frontend interface for Apache Cloudstack virtualization management system. Cloudstack itself is great product which is used widely but it's frontend is developed for administrators, not for end users. Some of behaviours are not transparent and not natural to average user and require quite long adaptation.

## Project Story

Since we run a Cloudstack managed public cloud for 3 years (actually we run CS 4.3 cloud) we found that average users which are familiar to Digital Ocean, Amazon and other VPS management systems feel uncomfortable with Cloudstack UI and tend to make operational mistakes. That's why we decided to implement end-user facing UI which covers regular activities which are important to project administrators.
